One effective way of securing SSH access to your cloud server is to use
a public-private key pair. This means that a public key is placed on
the server and a private key is placed on your local workstation.
Using a key pair makes it impossible for someone to log in by using just
a password, as long as you set up SSH to deny password-based
authentication.
